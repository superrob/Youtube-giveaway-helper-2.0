Youtube giveaway helper 2.0
===========================

This tool uses the Youtube GData API to fetch comments for a given video which it then uses to draw a random winner while showing an animation.
The tool allows the user to filter double comments and have experimental features like checking if the user is subscribed.

The repo is of my eclipse directory.
The program uses the async-http-client, jsoup, and slf4j libaries and are bundled for convenience.
